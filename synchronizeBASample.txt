*Synchronize against Local/Remote Folders
*Project name in AD Build Client, LOCAL_REMOTE, Full path of the folder where the sources exist, Virtual folder in AD Build Client, Members type within Virtual Folder,(optional)Filter the members by name, extensions 

*Example not using extensions. The entire folder's content is synchronized

*Examples using filtering(for member names, extensions included)
*MyProject,LOCAL_REMOTE,C:\IBM AD\Mainframe Sources\Local Sources,zOS Cobol,COBOL_MVS,filter(*.cbl | *.asm)
    *This line synchronizes only the files with extensions CBL and ASM
